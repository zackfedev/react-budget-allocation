# react-budget-allocation

... I developed some of the features in this Web app using hooks found in React, such as useContext to send and manipulate data with only one component, useReducer to manipulate fairly complex states such as adding, subtracting, validating, and deleting.
useState in some components is also used to manipulate some data in this app

### some features that can be tried

* You can add budget first to input with the sign **budget** on the webpage
* You can change currency at the **dropdown select** input to change currency at you want
* Button on the table can click when youre set the budget first 
* can interact with buttons with conditions that have been determined in each table title such as increase by 10, decrease by 10, and delete
* if you want to add a larger value for each quantity that has been determined you can do this using the input table at the bottom there are several 
options that **must be selected first to validate** the value to be added according to the value stated in the input

### validate/error can be throw when

* The budget is Empty / Youre not set budget 
* The quantity is Zero 
* You add value when the budget exceed the remaining
